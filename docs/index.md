﻿---title: Tableau Dashboard Design---Author: Hendrik A. Dreyer=========================Date: 20 June 2018==================Abstract--------*Tableau is widely used to build effective visualization, which are based onlarge datasets and in the process assist users in finding deeper insight in theassociated data. This report explains how a given dataset is manipulated,augmented and consumed by Tableau. Five questions, as anticipated in a topmanagement meeting scenario, are asked about the dataset. To answer the fivequestions a rationale is given for the design decisions that underly fourvisualizations. The four visualizations are used to build a final dashboard,which is presented to the stakeholders of the scenario. Overarching tasks areutilized that assists the presenter to effectively interact with the dashboardto convey a storyline to the stakeholders regarding the data.*Introduction------------This report describes the creation of a visualization dashboard as planned outin . The dashboard consists of four primary visualizations, which provideanswers to five individual questions. The five questions shape the underlyingnarrative of a scenario that takes place in a company’s weekly upper managerialmeeting. Such a meeting is attended by various stakeholders that are most likelyto generate the five questions in hand. The scenario is underpinned by fourindividual tasks which overlays and binds the four individual visualizationstogether.This report begins by describing the data that drives the four visualizations inthe dashboard as well as additional data sourced from Wikipedia that augmentsthe original dataset. The Methods section provides a detail description of theapproach that was followed in designing the four visualizations. Each of thefive questions is addressed separately along side the design choices that wentinto realizing each of the four visualizations.The final dashboard is then overviewed in the Results and Discussion sectionwhere the dashboard’s instructiveness and overlaid information is discussed.Finally, a conclusion is drawn which casts light on a hidden aspect discoveredabout the underlying dataset and why the dashboard succeeded in finding thisaspect.Data----The four visualizations are based on the data as received in . The data fileholds order information for a store that sells goods. The data file containsfour datasets; Orders, Returns, Users and Regions. The data in the Returndataset has been omitted because, the correlation between Orders and Returns hasproven to be insufficient. The Region dataset is empty and has therefore alsobeen omitted. Initial data exploration and evaluation proved to be frustratingin terms of depth of complexity and therefore, it was opted to includepopulation numbers of each state, as specified in the 2010 USA census , to thedata set. To amalgamate the three contributing datasets a left-outer-joinbetween the Orders, Users and USA census data was executed in Tableau. Thisproduced the final data set on which the dashboard was built.The final dataset resulted in 39 fields (including newly derived/calculatedfields);16 categorical (nominal), 7 categorical (ordinal) and 16 quantitative fields.Appendix A lists the layout of the left-outer-join structure as well as a table,which lists a partial view of the fields in the final dataset. The derived andcalculated data fields in the data set will be listed and described as part ofeach of the four individual visualizations as described in the Methods section.Methods-------Careful consideration was taken when decided which encoding methods should beused to most effectively and accurately convey insight into the underlying dataset. This was a very important exercise as it determined how effectively thefour visualizations could answer the five questions asked. This section listseach of the five questions along with the visualization that was chosen toanswer that question. An analysis of each visualization is then presented alongwith the chosen encoding methods that are utilized in the visualization.### Question 1**Stakeholder:** CEO of the company – “Please present me a geographical overviewof sales vs. profits, profit per capita and percentage profitability for thepast four years and break the map down in terms of the four geographical regionsthe company covers and also report on population, customer and order numbers perstate?”**Analysis**The first question is really three questions in one. The question calls forthree different views over a geographical area – North America. To satisfy thisrequirement in the question, Tableau’s worksheet overlay capability must beexploited. This entails the creation of three different worksheet, which arefocused on the same geographical area but, which emphasize different statisticsregarding the underlying data set. In the main dashboard the user is equippedwith a dropdown menu through which each of the three views can be called intofocus (Figure 3). The three menu options are associated to the three worksheetsin the following way:1.  Per Capita - Profit per Capita worksheet (Figure 4)2.  Total Sales - Sales vs. Profits worksheet (Figure 5)3.  Profitable – Percentage Profitability worksheet (Figure 6)For all three the above listed visualizations the following visual encodingrules were utilized:1.  Identity Channels: Longitude, Latitude, Spatial region2.  Magnitude Channels: Area (2D), Color saturation (divergent). The contrast of    the black circles and the red-green divergent color saturation scale works    well together in the sense that the two magnitude channels do not clash.3.  Markers: Text, Tooltip (Breakdown of transportation cost per product    category, Population total per state, Orders per state, Customers per state,    URL link to the selected state’s wiki page)To satisfy the temporal and regional selection requirement in question 1, anoverlaying couple of filters were implemented:1.  Timeframe filter – This filter enables the user to step through the    timeframe 2012 – 2015. The user can also opt to select an amalgamated total    view of statistics for all the years combined.2.  Region filter – This filter enables the user to view the statistics of each    of the four regions separately or all together.**Per Capita worksheet** - This worksheet illustrates the two per capitastatistics of each state. The black circle on each state illustrates thesales per capita quantity and the color saturation illustrates the profitper capita. These statistics are implemented by the following calculatedfields:Sales per Population = ∑ (Sales) / ∑ (Population LOD) andProfit per Population = ∑ (Profit) / ∑ (Population LOD)For Tableau to summate population numbers per state, the LOD (Level ofDetail) functionality of Tableau must be utilized . By hovering the mousepointer over each state an additional statistic is displayed – number ofcustomers and the population (Figure 7). This satisfies the “population andcustomer numbers” portion of question 1.**Total Sales worksheet -** This worksheet describes the total sales andtotal profits per state. The black circle on each state illustrates thetotal sales and the color saturation of each state illustrates the totalprofit. These statistics are the verbatim numbers as reported in the maindata set. By hovering the mouse pointer over each state an additionalstatistic is display – shipping cost as broken down per product category(Figure 8). This exploration is key in verifying an underlying issuediscovered in the dataset.**Percentage profitability worksheet -** This worksheet reports the profitof each state as a percentage of the total sales for each state. Thisstatistic is implemented by the following calculated field:% Profitability = [∑ (Profit) / ∑ (Sales)] x 100By hovering the mouse pointer over a state, an additional statistic isdisplayed for the state – number of orders (Figure 9). This satisfies the“number of orders” portion of question 1.By combining three worksheets in an overlaid fashion the initial canvasportion allocated to the dashboard can by tripled. If the user selects anyof the states on the map, the dashboard isolates the selected state byhighlighting it, dimming the rest of the map, displaying a tooltipassociated with the selected state and presents a url link at the bottom ofthe tooltip. This url link is a link to the selected state’s wiki page. Thismight come in helpful if management needs broader general informationregarding a state that is being discussed.### Question 2**Stakeholder:** Regional Managers – “We’d like to find out who our topcustomers are for each region and each state?”**Analysis**As this question requests a ranking order, it was deemed appropriate to choose ahorizontal bar chart to express this order (Figure 11). By ranking the customersin a descending order by total sales, it utilizes the attentive characteristicsof the chart and assist the users to quickly and easily identify the topcustomers. A text marker is placed next to each horizontal bar so that the usercan see the precise figure associated with the ranked customer. Three additionaltext markings are displayed with each of the horizontal bars - Rank, CustomerName and Region. The user can specify the number of customers to be viewed bytyping a number into the *Top N Customer – Sales* entry box, which is situatedat the top left-hand corner of this worksheet. The entry dialog box wasimplemented by a Tableau parameter – Integer with range 1 to N, a True/Falsefilter and a calculated field that calls the RANK Tableau function for all Salesin the following manner: RANK(∑ ([Sales]))By combining the number of customers specified in the *Top N Customer – Sales*entry box and the region filter, the user can easily and quickly view the topcustomers per region or in general. The following encoding rules were utilizedfor this visualization:1.  Identity Channels: Y-Axis Labelled, Text2.  Magnitude Channels: Position on common scale3.  Markers: TextFinally, a line is displayed vertically across the horizontal bars. This linepre-attentively indicates the average total sales of the selected N customersand it establishes an intuitive relation among the selected N customers.### Question 3**Stakeholder:** Company Accountant – “I’d like to see a profit and lossbreakdown over product sub-categories as well as the total sales for each of theproduct subcategories?”**Analysis**Profits and losses, by nature, ranges from negative to positive, i.e. a “loss”is a negative number and a “profit” is a positive number. For that reason, anordered butterfly bar chart was chosen (Figure 13). The visualization orders theproduct sub-categories from most profitable to least profitable. The horizontalnature of the chart also enables the categories listed down the Y-Axis to beeasily readable. The following encoding rules were utilized for thisvisualization:1.  Identity Channels: Y-Axis – Spatial region, Text2.  Magnitude Channels: X-Axis – Position on common scale, Color saturation    (divergent)3.  Markers: Text, TooltipA very strong cohesion is encoded onto the magnitude channel by super imposingcolor saturation onto the position of the common scale and then additionallyaugmenting it by the percentage profit text marks on each bar.By hovering the mouse pointer over each bar, a tooltip is displayed that reportsand additional statistic – total sales for the associated product sub-category(Figure 12). This satisfies the latter part of question 3.### Question 4**Stakeholder:** Marketing Manager –” I’d like you to query the dataset anddisplay a breakdown of customer segment spending over the main three productcategories for each region and express the ratios as part of the whole. Then,for each of these segments I’d also like to know what the percentageprofitability is?”**Analysis**Seeing that there are only three product categories – Furniture, Office Suppliesand Technology, the pie chart surfaces as a likely candidate. Pie charts are, bydefault, good at displaying 2 – 5 parts of a whole. But, the latter part of thequestion warrants the pie chart unfavorable as the visualization also needs totake customer segmentation into consideration. Therefore, it was opted to use astacked bar chart instead (Figure 14). However, to compare the percentage ofsales per customer segment over the three product categories, the stacked barchart visualization was expressed as a percentage of the whole, i.e. as parts of100% of the total sales per segment. The following encoding rules were utilizedfor this visualization:1.  Identity Channels: X – Axis, Color Hue.2.  Magnitude Channels: Y-Axis (Position on a common scale)3.  Markers: Text, TooltipThis visualization effectively compares percentage of total sales volume acrosscustomer segments and therefore satisfies the first part of the question. Byhovering the mouse pointer over each of the customer segments a tooltip displaysan additional statistic – percentage profitability of the customer segment(Figure 15). This satisfies the latter part of the question.### Question 5**Stakeholder:** CEO of the Company– “Can you identify any areas in thebusiness, which over the last 4 years, have effected profitability? And, why?”This question can only be answered by evaluating the dashboard as a whole. Referto the section labelled, Results and Discussion for the answer to this question.For all encoding rules in Questions 1 – 4, refer to and .### InteractivityA dashboard in Tableau consists of several worksheets that are arranged on onework area (canvas). Tableau enables the worksheets to function in an interactivemanner by ways of setting a filter option on each individual worksheet. Thedashboard for this assessment as illustrated in Figure 16, has the filter optionenabled on each of the four worksheets. This means that by selecting any of theelements (state, bar or segment in bar), will filter the underlying data set onthe selected element. During a selection of one of the elements on a worksheet,the other three worksheets will filter accordingly. This enables the user todrill down on specific elements of the underlying data set and explore howdifferent categories and elements relate to each other. Additional to the filterselection, the dashboard also incorporates the Region and Time filters as wellas the Top N Customers selector. By combining the above filter and selectionelements the dashboard presents a very strong explorative and interrogative toolas can be illustrated in . The following three figures illustrate variouscombination of filters, selectors and selections that can be combined:1.  Figure 16 – No filters and selectors set2.  Figure 17 – Time Filter = 2013, Region Filter = Central, State Selected =    Texas, Top N Customers = 1003.  Figure 18 – Time Filter = 2014, Customer Segment = Consumer, Top N Customers    = 10.The four tasks (present, discover, query and identify), which assists the userin effectively portraying a storyline to the stakeholders in the given scenario,are bound and supported by the interactive capabilities of the dashboard.Results and Discussion----------------------All requirements and criteria asked for from the four questions are answered bythe four visualizations. By utilizing part of the dashboard as an overlaysection, more information can be presented in a limit physical canvas area.Enabling tooltips for each visualization and also adding additional statisticalinformation to each tooltip enabled the user to satisfactory answer every aspectof the questions asked.The answer to the 5th question is as follows. In Figure 16, from the worksheetlabelled, Profitability of Product Sub-Category, one can easily identify thatthe products sub-category labelled, Tables, is incurring large losses for eachyear. Yet, from the worksheet labelled, Customer Segment it is easy to see thatthe Furniture product category (of which Tables is part) contribute to, onaverage, 33% of all sales across the four main customer segments. This meansthat a third of the company’s sales effort results in a substantial loss to thecompany. The reason for this becomes evident when the geographical map isexplored. By invoking the tooltip on the Total Sales and Profit map, one canobserve that for most of the states the shipping costs for Furniture aredisproportionally high as compared to the shipping costs of Technology andOffice Supplies. Therefore, a valid suggestion to top management would be tore-evaluate the Furniture section of the business. From the data it is observedthat the Furniture category of the business is drawing a significant saleseffort only to incur huge profit losses. Either, the company must abandon theFurniture category or, find a cheaper transportation solution for this productcategory.Conclusion----------By effectively utilizing the data wrangling capabilities of Tableau, one canmanipulate large data sets very effectively. By combining the given data withexternal sources, such as , one can enhance the base dataset and draw furtherinsight there from. Effective identity and magnitude channel pairing has led toa well correlated and cohesive answer set in the form of four visualizations,which answers the initial five questions in a sufficient manner. Tableau’sability to bind separate worksheet together in one coherent dashboard gives theuser the ability to effectively portray a story as well as gain deep insightinto the underlying dataset.Appendix A----------![](media/9ddbc2a344f7ed53789bbf16d1c4ffd2.png)A screenshot of a cell phone Description generated with very high confidenceFigure 1 – Dataset![](media/49d663636c565841e473a1c6b1cfee82.png)A picture containing screenshot Description generated with high confidenceFigure 2- Left outer join of Order, Population and UsersAppendix B----------![](media/d5a19319cb732f14e7d4d471e0254063.png)A screenshot of a cell phone Description generated with very high confidenceFigure 3 - Worksheet selector for geographical area![](media/eca32c9bae448bd2d1e59946f002f154.png)A close up of a map Description generated with high confidenceFigure 4 - Profit per Capita![](media/18c93615389c919e7e7b1dc85ae81a0a.png)A close up of a map Description generated with high confidenceFigure 5 - Sales vs. Profits![](media/1556d3a6ed5df49dca9171177f683397.png)A close up of a map Description generated with very high confidenceFigure 6 - Percentage Profitability![](media/292bf912de75b7ceba19095494e3275f.png)A close up of a sign Description generated with very high confidenceFigure 7 - Tooltip (Number of Customers)![](media/e3a12464e68fb197db2841a1486f21e9.png)A screenshot of a cell phone Description generated with high confidenceFigure 8 - Shipping Costs – Broken down per product category![](media/87240ae72787bb59a4f93cc6335970b8.png)A screenshot of a cell phone Description generated with high confidenceFigure 9 - Number of Orders![](media/5518684682cfa07c547e1a88ec82a6b4.png)A screenshot of a cell phone Description generated with high confidenceFigure 10 - Select Top N Customers![](media/dfbd6c6d1c8b3ff5279b8806fd76dc84.png)A screenshot of a cell phone Description generated with high confidenceFigure 11 - Top N Customers![](media/8700eada15faabf01b9633c0623dc2d2.png)A screenshot of a cell phone Description generated with very high confidenceFigure 12 - Total Sales per Product Sub-Category![](media/4e59392f9643267028a34240791c52cc.png)A screenshot of a cell phone Description generated with very high confidenceFigure 13 - Percentage profitability per Product Sub-Category![](media/860abc2dd0e88cb1249ba8c3b157b0ac.png)A screenshot of a cell phone Description generated with very high confidenceFigure 14 - Sales volume over Customer Segments![](media/504d9b72ae14b161d7f9d17ddf396c04.png)A screenshot of a cell phone Description generated with very high confidenceFigure 15 - Percentage Profitability for selected Customer Segment/Product Group![](media/bc35390e864c6c1302fcb7e3e9c3ef45.png)A close up of a map Description generated with very high confidenceFigure 16 – Dashboard![](media/e88246b0f14c7fce4545231e3afdbdde.png)A screenshot of a map Description generated with very high confidenceFigure 17 - Dashboard - Filter I![](media/b086c1645a32c9e39707e06b8bec82d0.png)A screenshot of a map Description generated with very high confidenceFigure 18 - Dashboard - Filter II
